                <p>Even the best designed web application, implemented by the most security-aware developers, is going to have security
                   risks. It’s simply unavoidable. Developers focus on functionality, not web security. Applications are constantly
                   changing. With new features designed and built against tight deadlines, it’s not surprising security critical
                   vulnerabilities within application code and server configurations are introduced all the time. Hackers probe for
                   vulnerabilities continuously, finding new security vulnerabilities in some of the most obscure web applications.Web security scanning is crucial to ensure your web application does not expose sensitive data. However, manual
                   security testing simply does not scale against a large number of web applications common. A web
                   application security scanner will identify defects vital to your web application security posture.</p><br>

                <h3><b>Find security vulnerabilities before attackers do with a website security scanner</b></h3>
                <p>Code reviews and manual tests aren’t exhaustive enough to find all security vulnerabilities. Apart from relying on the
                   developers and testers recognizing problems, they also don’t scale. Running an easy and quick scan with Acunetix
                   website security scanner to comprehensively probe your site to identify where your application is at risk.</p>

                    <h3><b>There are some common web scanning vulnerabilities</b></h3>
                    <li><b>Cross-site Scripting(XSS) Attack</b></li>
                    <p>Cross-site Scripting (XSS) refers to client-side code injection attack wherein an attacker can execute malicious
                    scripts (also commonly referred to as a malicious payload) into a legitimate website or web application. XSS is amongst
                    the most rampant of web application vulnerabilities and occurs when a web application makes use of unvalidated or
                    unencoded user input within the output it generates.</p><br>
                    <p>By leveraging XSS, an attacker does not target a victim directly. Instead, an attacker would exploit a vulnerability
                    within a website or web application that the victim would visit, essentially using the vulnerable website as a vehicle
                    to deliver a malicious script to the victim’s browser.</p><br>
                    
                    <li><b>SQL Injection</b></li>
                    <p>SQL Injection (SQLi) refers to an injection attack wherein an attacker can execute malicious SQL statements (also
                    commonly referred to as a malicious payload) that control a web application’s database server (also commonly referred
                    to as a <i>Relational Database Management System – RDBMS).</i>  Since an SQL Injection vulnerability could possibly affect any
                    website or web application that makes use of an SQL-based database, the vulnerability is one of the oldest, most
                    prevalent and most dangerous of web application vulnerabilities.</p><br>
                    <p>By leveraging an SQL Injection vulnerability, given the right circumstances, an attacker can use it to bypass a web
                    application’s authentication and authorization mechanisms and retrieve the contents of an entire database. SQL
                    Injection can also be used to add, modify and delete records in a database, affecting data integrity.
                    </p><br>
                    
                    <li><b>HTTP header injection</b></li>
                    <p>HTTP header injection is a general class of web application security vulnerability which occurs when Hypertext Transfer
                    Protocol (HTTP) headers are dynamically generated based on user input. Header injection in HTTP responses can allow for
                    HTTP response splitting, Session fixation via the Set-Cookie header, cross-site scripting (XSS), and malicious redirect
                    attacks via the location header. HTTP header injection is a relatively new area for web-based attacks, and has
                    primarily been pioneered by Amit Klein in his work on request/response smuggling/splitting</p><br>

                    <li><b>XML External Entity (XXE) injection</b></li>
                    <p>XML External Entity (XXE) refers to a specific type of Server-side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack, whereby an attacker
                    is able to cause Denial of Service (DoS) and access local or remote files and services, by abusing a widely available,
                    rarely used feature in XML parsers.</p><br>
                    <p>XML is a vastly used data format found in everything from web services (XML-RPC, SOAP, REST…) to documents (XML, HTML,
                    DOCX) and image files (SVG, EXIF data…) use XML. Naturally, where there is XML, there is an XML parser.</p><br>
